# **Build a UI Component Retrieval System with Pinecone (RAG-Based Semantic Search)**

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a UI component retrieval system using Pinecone and a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach for semantic search. The system allows users to query for UI components based on natural language descriptions and retrieves relevant components from a pre-defined dataset.

## Initial Setup

To get started, open Google Colab and set up a new empty notebook.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Run the following commands to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pinecone
pip install sentence-transformers
